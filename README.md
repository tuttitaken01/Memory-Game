# DOM Mini-App

The task was to make a simple website which the users can interact with. The core functionality I chose was to allow the user to play a memory game. Additional features included keeping track of the score, randomising the position of the cards, and styling the website.

To run the app, clone the repo and click "Go Live" in VS Code.

## App summary
- The game starts out with a series of paired images that are hidden from the user
- The first 2 images the user clicks on are revealed.
- If the revelaed images match they remain uncovered.
- If the images do not match, they are hidden once again.
- The user continues until they have matched all the images.

_Additional_
- Add a point for each pair found
- Randomise the starting position of the images to prevent cheating
